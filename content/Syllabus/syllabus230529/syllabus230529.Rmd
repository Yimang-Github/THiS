### 《中美关系与中国妇女》课程介绍 Women and Gender in Chinese History: Sino-U.S. Connections

#### 课程简介Course Overview

本课程为中级本科课程，主要涵盖十九世纪中期至二十世纪中期，在中美关系的大背景之下回顾中国妇女发展史，以及从性别的角度思考中美关系的多面性与复杂性。在外交、战争、宗教、教育、经济、文化等各个方面，中国与美国各自经历了重大变化，两国政府及非政府的关联极为密切。人流、物流、思想的频繁往来，造就了新机会，也导致了新摩擦。那么妇女史与中美关系史之间是如何互动的？本课程着重探讨中国妇女的历程，也会涉及到现代美国妇女的变化。



课程形式：混合式课程，50%线上，50%线下。Hybrid混合式学习有利于学生自主、自律地安排学习时间，最大限度发挥线上、线下不同学习方式的优势。



This course explores Chinese women’s and gender history by situating it in the interactions between China and the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries. Both countries went through drastic changes as they developed official and unofficial ties during this period. People, ideas, and things moved between these two countries across the Pacific. These movements resulted in new discoveries, exciting collaborations, and frictions. The course will introduce premodern Chinese gender ideals and practices before the era of Sino-U.S. entanglement. It explores how these ideals and practices traveled, encountered challenges, adapted, and changed in the cultural, educational, economic, political, and religious interactions between the two countries. We will focus on Chinese women in China and in the U.S., but American women will figure prominently in the course material as well.



In each learning module, you will interact with the instructor and your classmates both online and in person. The hybrid format gives you much flexibility and deeper learning experience. It also requires significant self-discipline and time management ability.

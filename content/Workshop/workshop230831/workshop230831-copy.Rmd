We are excited to launch THiS Workshop of Chinese Societies (WOCS) this fall! THiS WOCS provides a virtual platform for scholars who use qualitative/mixed methods to study Chinese societies to present and discuss their ongoing projects. The Zoom link is <https://concordia-ca.zoom.us/j/87086000893>

At THiS WOCS, we discuss research that advances the sociological understanding of contemporary & historical Chinese societies, broadly defined. We welcome presentations using ethnography, interview, comparative-historical methods, network analysis, computational methods, etc.

THiS WOCS will occur monthly on Wed at 8 PM (ET) during the Fall and Spring semesters. If you are interested in presenting your work in Spring 2024, please sign up here: <https://forms.gle/mVk46huH5eDLGvWMA>

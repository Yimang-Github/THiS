<p>We are excited to launch THiS Workshop of Chinese Societies (WOCS) this fall! THiS WOCS provides a virtual platform for scholars who use qualitative/mixed methods to study Chinese societies to present and discuss their ongoing projects. The Zoom link is <a href="https://concordia-ca.zoom.us/j/87086000893" class="uri">https://concordia-ca.zoom.us/j/87086000893</a></p>
<p>At THiS WOCS, we discuss research that advances the sociological understanding of contemporary &amp; historical Chinese societies, broadly defined. We welcome presentations using ethnography, interview, comparative-historical methods, network analysis, computational methods, etc.</p>
<p>THiS WOCS will occur monthly on Wed at 8 PM (ET) during the Fall and Spring semesters. If you are interested in presenting your work in Spring 2024, please sign up here: <a href="https://forms.gle/mVk46huH5eDLGvWMA" class="uri">https://forms.gle/mVk46huH5eDLGvWMA</a></p>

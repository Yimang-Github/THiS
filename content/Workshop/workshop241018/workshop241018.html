<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>What makes a law legitimate? How is compliance with new legislation achieved? This article suggests that answers to these questions require analyzing the “work of legitimacy,” namely the actors and practices involved in implementing the law and tasked with persuading social actors to comply with it. We argue that ANT’s concept of “translation” offers a useful model for analyzing the work of legitimacy, specifically how the interests of relevant social actors are translated so that compliance with the law becomes intelligible as a means of pursuing their own interests. Additionally, we argue that the social actor performing the work of legitimacy is not pre-given, but forms itself in and through the work of weaving a network across the boundary between state and society. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by examining the legitimization process of the 2008 labor law reform in one Chinese locality, Waterfront District in Pearl River Delta (PRD). We show how a loose coalition of local state officials, former officials, social organizations and labor lawyers translated the interests of large employers and managers to accord with the “public employment relations service” they offered, and thus harnessed them into compliance with the labor law.</p>

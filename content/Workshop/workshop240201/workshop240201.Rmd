We are excited to announce the Winter schedule of THiS Workshop of Chinese Societies (WOCS). THiS WOCS provides a virtual platform for scholars who use qualitative/mixed methods to study Chinese societies to present and discuss their ongoing projects. Zoom link: <https://concordia-ca.zoom.us/j/87086000893>

At THiS WOCS, we discuss research that advances the sociological understanding of contemporary & historical Chinese societies, broadly defined. We welcome presentations using ethnography, interview, comparative-historical methods, network analysis, computational methods, etc.

THiS WOCS will occur monthly on Wed at 8 PM (ET) during the Fall and Spring semesters. If you are interested in presenting your work in Fall 2024, please sign up here: <https://forms.gle/mVk46huH5eDLGvWMA>

Speaker: **Shitong Qiao**, Professor of Sociology, Duke University

Discussants: **Sida Liu**, Law School and Department of Sociology, University of Hong Kong; **Dali Yang**, Department of Political Science, University of Chicago; **Yueran Zhang**, Department of Sociology, University of California, Berkeley.

Moderator: Zhifan Luo, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Concordia University.

Time: February 14th, 8:00 PM (Eastern Time）/ February 15th, 9:00 AM (Beijing Time）

### Abstract

Chinese Communist Party (“CCP”) claimed that China’s fight against covid demonstrated the strength of the party-state’s institutions. Critics pointed to the prevalent violation of individual rights and numerous individual sufferings in China’s lockdowns both in Wuhan in 2020 and in Shanghai in 2022, and beyond. Both views take the party-state as the only player that mattered in the largest lockdowns in human history. Nobody has examined the role of the society in China’s covid lockdown, except for the Chinese official narrative of “the people’s war” which emphasizes how the party-state was able to mobilize hundreds of millions of volunteers in its fight against the covid, raising a question about the autonomy of civic organizations, and whether they played any role in monitoring and resisting the party-state’s encroachment on individual rights. Based on in-depth fieldwork including over ninety interviews and neighborhood visits in Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenzhen and Zhengzhou, this Article reveals the state’s limited capacity to enforce neighborhood lockdowns, implement mass covid tests and provide food to neighborhoods under lockdowns. The cooperation of citizens, particularly homeowners, was essential to the state in maintaining its covid control system. When such homeowners, who were cooperators of the government, protested by law, the government had no choice but to give in. Dependence brought power. Neither the government nor homeowners were free from the constraints imposed on them by each other. The Chinese case demonstrates a new paradigm of state-society relationship that I call “cooperating to resist,” challenges our understanding of power and legality in authoritarian regimes, and sheds new light on the relationship between property and sovereignty, specifically why and how property law provides a safe space of resistance for citizens in an authoritarian regime.

### Abstract

Scholars in cosmopolitanism have long debated on whether it is one type of identity privilege held by global elites or a vernacular (banal) global identification shared by members of peripheral and marginalized groups in their homelands. My research on Chinese Working Holiday Makers in Australia seeks to resolve this debate. Through exploring their identity as Chinese diaspora living in Western society, this study aims to demonstrate how temporal liminality affects their perception of their relationships with the home country, the host country, and people they encounter. Based on one year of fieldwork in Australia from 2017 to 2018 and three-month indepth interviews in summer 2023, I recognized that the working holiday program has been framed as a “culture policy” that inspires Chinese youth’s “cosmopolitan imaginary.” Aspiring to be “cosmopolitan,” some Chinese youths end up in an environment mired by constraint, precarity, immobility, and exploitation based on race, gender, and nationality in Australia. I argue that their status of vulnerability, caused by being temporary workers, is an extension of the liminality they had suffered in China, which further explains how class/stratification operates transnationally. This research contributes to the current discussion on transnational youth mobilities by centering home country’s contexts to examine how and why some Chinese youths feel disillusioned with the "Chinese Dream" and desire to exit and find alternatives in another country. In the meantime, this research also contributes to the new conceptualizations of cosmopolitanism by discussing the relation between nationalism and cosmopolitanism. This study will disrupt the stereotype of Chinese youth as hyper-nationalistic and shed light on their complex, individualized relationships with their country.

## April Workshop

**The Double-Conscious Formation of an Organizational Field: Chinese Civil Society Organizations in the U.S., 1850-1911**

Speaker: Simon Shachter, PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology, University of Chicago

Discussants: **Weirong Guo**, University of Pennsylvania

Time: To be determined

Moderator: Le Lin, Department of Sociology, University of Hawaii

### Abstract

How does resistance to racism manifest in a community’s organizational field? In this paper, I combine Du Bois’s concept of Double Consciousness with organizational field theory to build a field-level theory of racial resistance. While race scholarship has undertheorized community-based organizational ecosystems and fields, theories of organizational fields have not taken seriously the multifaceted role of race as a field-defining institution. I use insights from both of these traditions to explain why 19th century Chinese organizations formed such a sophisticated, interconnected, and complex organizational field that looked quite different from past and contemporary Chinese or U.S.-based organizational fields. I take a longitudinal, processual approach showing how this organizational field developed alongside the racialization of the Chinese community in the U.S. In doing so, this case shows how the agency of racial resistance forms at the community level and how a dynamic racialization process structures an organizational field.

## May Workshop

### Abstract

The Chinese grassroots bureaucracy today has been plauged by excessive paperwork that local cadres perceived as burdensome formalities. In this paper, by investigating the structural factors and the political logic underlying organizational red tape, I tackled the question of why formalism persists even though both the central leadership and grassroots bureaucrats dislike it. I discussed the specific components of the “paper mountain” and identified two kinds of paperwork that have overburdened grassroots cadres – excessive documentation (Trace-ism) and overproduction of forms (or statistical overload). 

I attribute “Trace-ism” to three interrelated factors: First, due to the flawed performance measurement and distorted incentive scheme, documentation outweighs substantive work and outcomes in performance evaluations and inspections. Second, as the authoritarian political oversight of the bureaucracy can only rely on top-down and internal monitoring, grassroots bureaucrats are forced to document everything they do when the central principal desires to maximize control over local agents. Third, the politicization of governance and administrative tasks and the intensification of the accountability system has further incentivized risk-averse agents to turn to formalities and documentation as self-protective strategies. 

The phenomenon that the grassroots bureaucracy has been flooded with statistical forms reveals the fundamental tension between the leadership’s ambition of building an all-seeing state and the limited informational capacity of the grassroots bureaucracy. Compounded by problems intrinsic to the bureaucratic system, the overproduction of forms and figures fails to generate better information that can help enhance governance quality. Despite the huge consumption of grassroots cadres’ time and energy, “statistical/big data management” gives the authorities only the illusion of greater control. Even worse, the prevalent statistical falsification and low-quality or distorted data can do more harm to state governance if they form the basis of policymaking. Drawning on extensive fieldwork and survey of grassroots cadres across China, this study enrichs our understandings of the Chinese bureaucratic system.
